           <p>This Privacy Policy is made by TopTech Realty, LLC, an Oregon limited liability company (referred to as “we” or us or our). We respect the privacy of our customers. This policy is designed to help you understand what information we gather, how we use it, and how it is protected. In our ongoing effort to improve the products and services we provide to our customers, we continue to implement new technologies and policies from time to time. As a result, this policy is subject to change without prior notice, and we will post any revision on our website. We encourage you to review our policy periodically because, when you do business with us or use our website, you accept this policy and are subject to its terms.</p>
           <h3>Information We Obtain</h3>
           <p>When you provide us with information about yourself, your properties, your tenants, and others, we collect and store that information (collectively, “Data”). Information that we consider to be personal is your name, ownership, social security number (SSN) or employer identification number (EIN), address, telephone number, email address, credit card numbers, birth date (if applicable), and information about your web activities (“Personal Information”).</p>

<p>You may also provide us information about third parties, such as your tenants and service providers. You represent that you have authority to provide such information to us. You also permit us to use such personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>If you believe that any Data has been provided to us improperly, or to otherwise exercise any rights relating to Data, please contact us immediately.</p>

<p>If you use and interact with our websites, we automatically collect log files and other information about your device and your usage of our websites through cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or other identifiers. We may collect and store information about the services purchased and provided, and the website pages viewed by all of our website visitors. Our goal is to improve your experience by being more responsive to your needs and preferences.</p>

<p>If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers).</p>

<h3>Information Usage</h3>
<p>We believe that your Personal Information should be kept as private as possible. We will not share your Personal Information with, and we will not sell your Personal Information to, other people or other companies who are not affiliated with us, except as necessary to provide you services. We may access your account, view/add/update Personal Information and other Data at any time, including without limitation to provide support services.</p>

<p>Data may be used to provide you services, to obtain services for your properties, and to meet any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. We will share Data to the extent necessary for third parties to assist us in providing you services.</p>

<p>We process your Data to conduct marketing research, advertise to you, provide personalized information about us on and off our websites and to provide other personalized content based upon your activities and interests to the extent it is necessary for our legitimate interest in advertising our websites or, where necessary, to the extent you have provided your prior consent.</p>

<p>We process your Data when cooperating with public and government authorities, courts or regulators in accordance with our legal obligations under applicable laws to the extent this requires the processing or disclosure of Data to protect our rights or is necessary for our legitimate interest in protecting against misuse or abuse of our websites, protecting personal property or safety, pursuing remedies available to us and limiting our damages, complying with judicial proceedings, court orders or legal processes or to respond to lawful requests.</p>

<p>If we are involved in a merger, reorganization, dissolution or other fundamental corporate change, or sell a website or business unit, or if all or a portion of our business, assets or stock are acquired by third party, we would share Data with such third party.</p>

<p>Our websites are not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such Personal Information from our systems.</p>

<p>We determine the appropriate retention period for Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). After expiry of the applicable retention periods, Data will be deleted.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of California, under the age of 18, and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our websites. Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, because, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another visitor to our websites.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We understand that you may be concerned about internet security. We employ industry-standard technologies to store sensitive information and protect it in transit over the internet. While we follow generally accepted standards to protect Data, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites after your sessions.</p>
